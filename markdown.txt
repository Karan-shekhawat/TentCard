# Build a Complete Web App which genearte Conference Style Nameplateswith direct browser print.

Create a web based app that contains everything:. The app must run instantly on any browser and be fully functional offline after first load.

### Core Requirements:
1. **Purpose**: Generate foldable conference name plates where the name is printed once right-side-up and once rotated 180° so that when folded in half and placed in a holder, the name is always readable from both sides.
- When printed and folded in half, the name is readable from both sides  
- Designed for standard tent-style name plate holders
2. **Paper Support**: A4 by default, with toggle for Letter. Portrait by default but can change to landscape.
3. **Two plates per page** automatically if total height allows (≤ 21 cm for A4), otherwise one per page.

4. **Multi-line support**:
   - Line 1: Full name (largest font)
   - Line 2: Designation + Company (smaller, e.g., "CEO, xAI")
   - Optional Line 3 if needed
   - Auto-scale secondary text to ~75% size and slightly lighter/italic by default

5. **Input Methods** (both supported):
   - Large textarea where user can paste:
	John Doe, CEO, xAI
	Jane Smith, CTO, Google
	Dr. Alice Brown, Research Director, OpenAI
   - Auto-parsing: each line = one name plate, comma or "—" separates title/company
   - Also support Manual Adding each name plate's name and smaller secondary line. 

6. **Customization (minimalist UI)**:
- Width (5–20 cm) and Height (2–15 cm) sliders with live cm display
- Font family: 6-10 options (Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New, Verdana, Inter, Cambria)
- Font size base (10–30pt)
- Text color (black default + 8 preset colors)
- Bold / Italic toggles
- Border: None / Thin / Medium / Thick
- Secondary text scale (60%–90% slider, default 75%)
- All changes update preview instantly (debounced)

7. **Preview**:
- Default: **Flat print preview** showing exact A4/Letter page layout with:
- Dashed center fold line
- Optional light cut marks
- All plates perfectly positioned
- Optional toggle: "Fancy 3D View" (simple CSS hover rotateY on one sample plate — off by default)
- Live update on every change (debounced 200ms)

8. **Printing**
- Big **"Print Now"** button  
- Opens browser print dialog (Ctrl+P) with perfect @media print styles:
- 1 cm scale ruler on first page only (for verification)
- Print first page as a sample page and let user click on continue to create next pages or click on adjust/cancel button to do modifications.
- No UI, no margins, no headers/footers
- Exact cm sizes preserved
- Backgrounds and borders print correctly
- Works perfectly in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari

9. **Low-End Optimizations**:
- No Canvas 3D, no heavy libraries
- Debounce all input events
- Lazy-render preview only when in viewport

10. **UI/UX Must Be**:
- Single page, no navigation
- Clean, minimalist, lots of white space
- Mobile-friendly (touch sliders)
- Load with a sample name ("Elon Musk, Founder, xAI") so user sees it instantly
- All controls in left sidebar, right sidebar = preview

### Final Deliverable
